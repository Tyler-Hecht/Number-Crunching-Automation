# For orders_automation:
Place the .py and .bat file in a folder along with the .xlsx file and the trialtypes file ("trialtypes.txt")\
There should be only one .xlsx file in the folder!\
The sheets of the xlsx file should be named something like "Order 1"\
The run.bat file runs the code on windows\
On Mac, run it in the command line\
The code requires pandas and openpyxl to be installed\
Things that aren't implemented but can be done:\
-Allow for sheets with order numbers in the double digits (e.g. "Order 10")\
-Automatically create a trialtypes file given configurations of fps and fpt (and maybe windows)\
-Anything else as needed
