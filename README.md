# Important:
This code requires pandas and openpyxl to be installed

## For orders_automation:
Place the .py and .bat file in a folder along with the .xlsx file and the trialtypes file ("trialtypes.txt")\
There should be only one .xlsx file in the folder!\
The sheets of the xlsx file should be named something like "Order 1"\
Run the .py file in the command line

## For participants_automation
Place the .py file in the same folder as the xlsx_to_txt stuff along with the order sheet .xlsx file\
Run it in the command line, and it will create the participants.txt file\
The xlsx_to_txt file must have been run before this so that it has those .txt files to reference\
